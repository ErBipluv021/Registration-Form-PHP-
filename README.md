# Registration-Form-PHP-
Simple registration form using PHP, HTML, CSS, Database.
If you want to do it on your own you can do it following the steps below:
  1.Firstly, you need to have XAMPP installed with PHP extension on your system.
  2.After that you need to copy the files and put into the htdocs within a folder.
  3.Run the code by starting XAMPP with initializing the Apache Server plus the Database.
  4.Then access the project by opening a browser using localhost on your url link.
  5.Then throught the website go to phpmyadmin then create a database user and then import the file user.sql into it.
  6.After that run the code by putting localhost/the_folder_name
  7.The page will be displayed and fill the details and register it.
  8.It works fully, and if you don't get the reach me out in github.
